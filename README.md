# Data Generation using SimPy for Machine Learning

## Simulation Tool
SimPy – a Python-based discrete-event simulation framework.

## Problem Description
A queueing system was simulated to model customer arrivals and service behavior.

## Parameters
- Arrival rate: 1–10 customers/min
- Service rate: 2–15 customers/min
- Simulation time: 50–200 minutes

## Data Generation
1000 simulations were run with randomly sampled parameters.

## Machine Learning Models
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Regression
- KNN

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Squared Error
- R² Score

## Results
Random Forest achieved the best predictive performance.

## Conclusion
Simulation-based data generation using SimPy effectively supports ML model training when real data is unavailable.
